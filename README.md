# ChordReplacer

Project entirely realized by:

Antonino Natoli (928370)
Michele Pilia (915389)
Politecnico di Milano

## Goals

The main purpose of this project is to create a Web application that allows even inexperienced users to generate beautiful and innovating chord sequences using the standard notation and to apply harmonic substitutions suggested by the system.

The chord track can be played by the system in two different modes:
1) With an internal, stand-alone subtractive Synth
2) Sending MIDI message to an external software or device

## Specifics

Languages used:
1) HTML 
2) CSS 
3) JavaScript (with particular references to Web Audio API

Furthermore, following the syllabus of Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies course, Firebase has been used to allow users to store and load custom presets
